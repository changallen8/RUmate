# RUmate

RUmate (pronounced roommate) is a roommate finder app for Rutgers University students.
There are four main tabs: Home, Matches, Messages, Profile.
This is an example Home Screen with generated data:
<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/screenshots/Home.png" width="350" title="Figure 1">
</p>
<br>
From the Home Screen, clicking on a profile card will get you to the details page.
This page will show a little more information about the potential roommate.
This is an example Details Screen:

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="/screenshots/Details.png" width="350" title="Figure 1">
</p>
The profile page will show the desired profile picture, name, year, preferred location, and a brief description. This description is shown on the details page if someone clicks your profile. There are also social media icons that can be mapped to your desired accounts. This is a base layout of the profiles screen so far:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/screenshots/Profile.png" width="350" title="Figure 1">
</p>

May need to add a place to edit your preferences (e.g. No Smoking, Male roommate, Quiet hours 10-2, etc). These preferences are the ones that show up on the details page, and is what will be used to generate matches.

### Todo:
- Finish messages screen. Doesn't need full functionality yet (no real database)
- Include a match feature, similar to Tinder
- Add an account feature: sign up, log in, log out.
- Use database to connect profiles, matches, and messages to accounts
