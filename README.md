# RUmate

RUmate (pronounced roommate) is a roommate finder app for Rutgers University students.
There are four main tabs: Home, Matches, Messages, Profile.
This is an example Home Screen with generated data:

</p>
<br>
From the Home Screen, clicking on a profile card will get you to the details page.
This page will show a little more information about the potential roommate.
This is an example Details Screen:
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="/screenshots/Details.png" width="350" title="Figure 1">

Currently working on the profile page, including edits. This is a base layout of the profiles screen so far:
